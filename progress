JUNE 15
Look at ghoulslash's message to figure out how to build a blank screen... perhaps?

JUNE 14
Not going to stress about the unwritten text in the intro, esp since it's all going away soon.

next step is overwriting everything on the screen after player shrink to be all white.

JUN 12
Need to figure out how text is printed and erased in the bottom box. I should look at either functions to figure that out.

JUN 11
Basic structure is there,but everything needs to be cleaned up. 
I shouldn't take any shortcuts here because the next step is drawing a bunch of shit onto the screen anyways.
Act 0.3 is the letter from YC
Act 0.4 is choosing a starter, should draw a shitty menu and use "select Pokepic" and putting custom pokemon into the player's party

Need to write a new function for asking about hair, eye and skin colors

should probably live on line 2234 and just copy the gender menu for now

JUN 10
Task_NewGameBirchSpeech_SlidePlatformAway is where i'm starting from on line 1907 of main_menu.c. How do I make it so that the platform is insivible until after the platform slides to the left?

- GO through each case in the switch statment, comment them out line by line
- Mark anything that impacts seeing the background
- port it all to emerald until a background renders
- try to rip out what doesn't actually matter

- Task_OaksSpeech1 in FRLG is the key to getting the background to load... need to break that down further.

JUNE 4
- line 2241 in menu.c still needs to be fixed
- sound does not work at all, need to figure that out
- why does background palette not load? (probably line 2241)

JUNE 3
- working backwards to figure out why functions are throwing errors
- TopBarWindowString in mainmenu.c is throwing an error
- Go to the source of TopBarWindowString, which is menu.c, turns out FillWindowPixelBuffer is the problem
- Need to add printing functions in FillWindowPixelBuffer to find out where in THERE things are breaking and go from there
- this is in line 457 in window.c

- SEPERATELY, line 2241 in menu.c needs to be permanently fixed

JUNE 2
- got intro sorta working
