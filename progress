SEP 17
trying to figure out why first letter is missing

SEP 10
want to use the "no item in bag" script to test the text I wrote for starter select

SEP 8
Text is printed on the screen. Carve out into its own file, list TODOs in the file, move onto next part.

SEP 7
Creating a new branch. Going to use the diploma screen and reverse engineer it to be the YC Acceptance Letter. Need to figure out why I can't compile rn.

SEP 2
Got MySpecial to work, need to stop screen from turning black and then focus on printing tex

AUG 31
After I compile, there is only one option in the start menu. figure out why.
once done, make MySpecial run in the DebugMenuCallback function..

AUG 14
bit by bit, adding a debug option to the start menu

AUG 9
the sample myspecial compiles. looking at quest menu and seeing if I can edit in a general test option in the menu for testing purposes.

AUG 6
Going through ghoulslash's code and figuring out what each line actually does

JUNE 15
Look at ghoulslash's message to figure out how to build a blank screen... perhaps?

JUNE 14
Not going to stress about the unwritten text in the intro, esp since it's all going away soon.

next step is overwriting everything on the screen after player shrink to be all white.

JUN 12
Need to figure out how text is printed and erased in the bottom box. I should look at either functions to figure that out.

JUN 11
Basic structure is there,but everything needs to be cleaned up. 
I shouldn't take any shortcuts here because the next step is drawing a bunch of shit onto the screen anyways.
Act 0.3 is the letter from YC
Act 0.4 is choosing a starter, should draw a shitty menu and use "select Pokepic" and putting custom pokemon into the player's party


JUN 10
Need to write a new function for asking about hair, eye and skin colors

should probably live on line 2234 and just copy the gender menu for now

JUN 10
Task_NewGameBirchSpeech_SlidePlatformAway is where i'm starting from on line 1907 of main_menu.c. How do I make it so that the platform is insivible until after the platform slides to the left?

JUN 9
writing a new array in field_player_avatar to index all the platable sprites
then writing a function in event_objects.h to look in that function
then calling that function on line 1408 of naming.screen.c to grab the right icon

JUN 8
working on Birch speech. need to figure out how to add more options to gender menu in order to pick a body.

JUNE 6
tested everything in FRLG above line 562 (case 7)

JUNE 5
- GO through each case in the switch statment, comment them out line by line
- Mark anything that impacts seeing the background
- port it all to emerald until a background renders
- try to rip out what doesn't actually matter

JUNE 4
- Task_OaksSpeech1 in FRLG is the key to getting the background to load... need to break that down further.

JUNE 4
- line 2241 in menu.c still needs to be fixed
- sound does not work at all, need to figure that out
- why does background palette not load? (probably line 2241)

JUNE 3
- working backwards to figure out why functions are throwing errors
- TopBarWindowString in mainmenu.c is throwing an error
- Go to the source of TopBarWindowString, which is menu.c, turns out FillWindowPixelBuffer is the problem
- Need to add printing functions in FillWindowPixelBuffer to find out where in THERE things are breaking and go from there
- this is in line 457 in window.c

- SEPERATELY, line 2241 in menu.c needs to be permanently fixed

JUNE 2
- got intro sorta working
- need to investigate gMain tasks and taskId to figure out how to move things along
- why don't other messages print on screen?
- why doesn't background render?

MAY 31
- game compiles with black text and then crashes
- need to move over graphics (Pika / Grass) and see if that's the problem
- diagnose from there

MAY 29
- compiler was ignoring file changes
- i did a commit, pushed, then make clean, and now assembler is looking for main.menu.s which... doesn't exist at all and never did. 
- unsure what i broke!
- need to investigate why it won't compile at all:

MAY 27
- moving functions from FRLG to Emerald, line by line

MAY 26
Building up empty functions in emerald and practicing with creating new shit

MAY 22 2021
Act 0 Plan
- Create new screen before Birch speech
- Cut Birch speech down to the following:
	- what is your name?
	- what are your pronouns? (gender assign)
	- which body would you like to use (simple menu)
- eye, skin, hair color menus (do nothing)
- start in truck

FEB 8 2021

- learn C
- figure out how to edit birch's opening speech.
- port over the opening from FRLG to emerald. 
- finish learning how to write act 0 in your game
