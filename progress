JUN 10
Need to write a new function for asking about hair, eye and skin colors

should probably live on line 2234 and just copy the gender menu for now

JUN 10
Task_NewGameBirchSpeech_SlidePlatformAway is where i'm starting from on line 1907 of main_menu.c. How do I make it so that the platform is insivible until after the platform slides to the left?

JUN 9
writing a new array in field_player_avatar to index all the platable sprites
then writing a function in event_objects.h to look in that function
then calling that function on line 1408 of naming.screen.c to grab the right icon

JUN 8
working on Birch speech. need to figure out how to add more options to gender menu in order to pick a body.

JUNE 6
tested everything in FRLG above line 562 (case 7)

JUNE 5
- GO through each case in the switch statment, comment them out line by line
- Mark anything that impacts seeing the background
- port it all to emerald until a background renders
- try to rip out what doesn't actually matter

JUNE 4
- Task_OaksSpeech1 in FRLG is the key to getting the background to load... need to break that down further.

JUNE 4
- line 2241 in menu.c still needs to be fixed
- sound does not work at all, need to figure that out
- why does background palette not load? (probably line 2241)

JUNE 3
- working backwards to figure out why functions are throwing errors
- TopBarWindowString in mainmenu.c is throwing an error
- Go to the source of TopBarWindowString, which is menu.c, turns out FillWindowPixelBuffer is the problem
- Need to add printing functions in FillWindowPixelBuffer to find out where in THERE things are breaking and go from there
- this is in line 457 in window.c

- SEPERATELY, line 2241 in menu.c needs to be permanently fixed

JUNE 2
- got intro sorta working
- need to investigate gMain tasks and taskId to figure out how to move things along
- why don't other messages print on screen?
- why doesn't background render?

MAY 31
- game compiles with black text and then crashes
- need to move over graphics (Pika / Grass) and see if that's the problem
- diagnose from there

MAY 29
- compiler was ignoring file changes
- i did a commit, pushed, then make clean, and now assembler is looking for main.menu.s which... doesn't exist at all and never did. 
- unsure what i broke!
- need to investigate why it won't compile at all:

MAY 27
- moving functions from FRLG to Emerald, line by line

MAY 26
Building up empty functions in emerald and practicing with creating new shit

MAY 22 2021
Act 0 Plan
- Create new screen before Birch speech
- Cut Birch speech down to the following:
	- what is your name?
	- what are your pronouns? (gender assign)
	- which body would you like to use (simple menu)
- eye, skin, hair color menus (do nothing)
- start in truck

FEB 8 2021

- learn C
- figure out how to edit birch's opening speech.
- port over the opening from FRLG to emerald. 
- finish learning how to write act 0 in your game
