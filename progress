- working backwards to figure out why functions are throwing errors
- TopBarWindowString in mainmenu.c is throwing an error
- Go to the source of TopBarWindowString, which is menu.c, turns out FillWindowPixelBuffer is the problem
- Need to add printing functions in FillWindowPixelBuffer to find out where in THERE things are breaking and go from there
- this is in line 457 in window.c

- SEPERATELY, line 2241 in menu.c needs to be permanently fixed
