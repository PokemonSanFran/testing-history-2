        Our lives become **much much easier** if you can provide (open links in a new tab!):

        * A gif or image of the issue happening. If you're able to capture that, you can upload them to [imgur](https://imgur.com/). Please post the resulting link in the next text field.

        * Your save file. This lets me figure out exactly what you did to get in the state you are in. It _should_ be the file called `pokeemerald.sav`, and you can upload it to [file.io](https://www.file.io). Please post the resulting link in the next text field.

        * You can see on how to perfect either of these tasks [here](https://i.imgur.com/XiWo17q.gif).
